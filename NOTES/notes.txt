Web application :

- application available across the network

Internet :

- Network of network
- Exchange the data over network

Web :

- Share the data \ retrive the data from the internet 
- Web browser to access the web page

How web application is made ?

- Client side scripting :code that runs on the browser 
eg : html,css,ajax
- Server side scripting : code runs on the Server
eg : java,python,c#..

Web server vs web browser :

WB - client side software that helps you to locate some content (text,images,video,audio..)

WS : handles the client request

Browser----> Request ----> Server(process your request)
 <-----------Response


 HTTP : Hyper text transfer protocol
 HTTPS : Security

 Web form :

 - all in one place (Design,code,source)
 - Difficulty to develop and debug
 - single change \ refresh - entire page has to reload again 

 MVC : modularise your application
 - easy to develop and debug 

 Model :data
 View : UI
 Controller : interacts with the data and UI

 - Handle the request
 - Single page application 


 CLI :


 dotnet new mvc -n "helloapp"

 Architecture :

 HTTPRequest -----> Middleware--->Routing---->Controller----->Action method ---->View(Render)--->Response


 Middleware : Software that handles the request and response pipeline.

 Controller :

 - Logic
 - handle the user actions
 - Render the view
 - create the controller only inside the controller Folder
 - Begin with capital letter
 - Many action methods


 Action methods:

 - Methods inside controller
 - should perform Logic
 - All the actions methods MUST BE PUBLIC
 - [NonAction] - will not be executed 
 - [ActionName("namehere")]
 - HTTP VERBS [get,put,post,delete]

URL(without parameters):

https://localhost:7122/user/check

URL (parameters):

https://localhost:7122/user/check?username=jeni&attempt=3
